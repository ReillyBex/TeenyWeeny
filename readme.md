# TeenyWeeny
A small form factor delta printer designed to be rigid and compact. I created most of the parts myself, but I also modified existing designs in the community. Credit is given below to the models I either used directly or modified. 

Print volume is __mm diameter circle x 120mm in Z. Arm Length is 85mm. Delta Radius is __.
