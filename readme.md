A small form factor delta printer designed to be rigid and compact. I created most of the parts myself, but I also modified existing designs in the community. Credit is given below to the models I either used directly or modified. 

Print volume is 75mm diameter circle x 120mm in Z. Arm Length is 85mm. Delta Radius is __.      

The method I used to assemble the printer was as follows:      
first, I assembled each foot by inserting heat sets and getting the modified BZI installed.      
I then connected all the feet together by the 1515 100mm extrusions, taking care to preload M3 nuts for th skirt mounting and th extruder mount.      
once the "bottom ring" was complete i assembled the top braces by installing heat set inserts and the NEMA 17 motors. the 695 bearings might be a tight pressfit so use one of the 100mm extrusions for leaversge if needed.      
Next, I installed the electronics onto the mount and mounted the extrusions to the electronics mount.       
After preloading M3 nuts to th bottom of yhe 100mm extrusions connected to the eectronics mount, I added the top braces to complete the "top ring".      
Center the linear rails on yhe remaining extrusions, both lengthwise and side to side on th face. the rail alignment tool from V0 is useful here, though you might need to clip one side shorter to not interfere woth the other linear rail.     
I assembled th carriages next. I also deracked the two linear rails at this point.     
I placed the vertical extrusions into yhe feet first, and then afded the top ring after. Tighten the M3x8 screws into the ends of the extrusuons first! then do the 4 remaining screws.
