# TeenyWeeny

![Printer Render](https://github.com/ReillyBex/TeenyWeeny/blob/master/LatestRevRender.JPG?raw=true)

A small form factor delta printer designed to be rigid and compact. I created most of the parts myself, but I also modified existing designs in the community. Credit is given below to the models I either used directly or modified. 

Print volume is 75mm diameter circle x ~120mm in Z. Arm Length is 85mm. Delta Radius is 38.1, Print_Radius is 37.
